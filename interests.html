	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>My name is Lucas Strycker. I'm 19 years old, and am a Computer 
	Science major here at
	Chico State. I've had a huge passion for tech ever since I was
	young, with an insatiable curiosity on how things work.</p>
	<p>Here are some of my hobbies:</p>
	<div class = "outer">
		<div style = "width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;">
			<ul>
				<li>Gaming (PC, Wii U, PS3). My favorite genre Action
				RPGS, and I also invest heavily into rhythm
				games.</li>
				<li>Anime. Some of my favorites are Fate/Zero, Hunter
				x Hunter, and The Tatami Galazy, to name a few.</li>
				<li>Programming! For more info, check out the 
				Computing Biography page!</li>
				<li>Exercise. I got into this only recently, but I have
				begun to care for my health and wish to be in
				healthy physical condition.</li>
				<li>Music. Because of my gaming and anime roots, I have
				unconventional tastes in music, favoring J-Rock
				and J-Pop mainly. I also have a very casual
				interest in EDM.</li>
