	<h1>My Computing Biography</h1>
	<p>As previously stated in my interests page, I have always had
	a curiosity for computers ever since I was an infant. What
	really set things off for me was the Nintendo 64, my first
	gaming system, which brought me head first into the realm
	of gaming. Ever since I've been fascinated, but intimidated,
	by the realm of tech, but I finally decided to follow my
	desires and major in Computer Science, as I have always
	been interested in not only the what, but the how and why of
	computers.</p>
	<p>I've had some prior experience programming before this course,
	having previously taken CSCI111, Programming and Algorithms I,
	along with having taught myself Python and having gone through
	a small portion of the <a target="blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.com">Free 
		Code Camp's</a> Front End Developer track,
	really only making my way through the basics of HTML and CSS, with
	some limited knowledge of jQuery. I know little about JavaScript
	itself, however, but I am eager to learn.</p>
